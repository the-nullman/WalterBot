# WalterBot
A silly Discord bot written with the help of discord.js and JavaScript.

# Installation 
In order for you to use the bot, you will need:
- Node.js (currently 19.3.0)
- discord.js (Node module. v14.11.0)

In `config.json`, you need to replace these values:
- `BOT_TOKEN` with your bot token,
- `DEV_DASHBOARD_APP_ID` with the application ID from the Discord Developer portal,
- `SERVER_ID` with the ID of the server the bot is added to. Required for the slash commands to work (global slash commands take up to 24 hours to refresh, local guild slash commands are instantaneous).
